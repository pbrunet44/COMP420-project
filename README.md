# COMP420-project
SQL project for COMP 420: A database for a fictional dog shelter.

Philip Brunet and Darius Jones


# Due Date: Week 17

## Milestone: For Part IV, you will submit your entire database to the Dropbox and include:

 DDL (25pts) – represents the entire DB schema, including table structures, primary and foreign key constraints, datatypes, data constraints, table indexes and relationships. Your DB should consist of at least 12 entities of suitable complexity (3-10 attributes).
DML (25pts) – Represents views (5), queries as stored procedures (12) and triggers (3) to facilitate information retrieval across your system. Think about the DML in terms of business needs and data administration. In essence, queries are algorithms for information retrieval and should therefore be of a certain complexity to justify their existence. Therefore, a large percentage of your grade will consider such complexity and will be based on your understanding of table joins and query manipulation. Consequently, you are expected to create at least 20 database objects (views, stored procedures and triggers) of varying levels of complexity and provide a rationale for each query.
